<p> <strong> <em>Jews have a long history in India, being here for thousands of years,
   forming a small community within the mosaic of Indian communities.
    Different than other minorities (such as Jains, Sikhs, Buddhists),
     the Jews originally came from outside India to make their home.
     Just before the historic visit of Indian Prime Minister Modi to
     Israel in summer 2017 he penned a joint op-ed with Netanyahu,
      the Prime Minister of Israel.
     They recognized this migration of Jews to India when they wrote:

I just need to adjust how I think and accept that the traffic

<td>Drupal Camp Goa was a great place to meet the Drupal community in India and I was determined to find out as much as I could about what was going on there. What I learned was that the community is hugely vibrant and doing amazing things —at a scale I simply never grasped before.

I was invited to do an opening talk at the beginning of the weekend and I chose to speak about community, as is my want, and how we can ensure that the whole World is aware of the community here. It is well documented in Dries’ blog posts that the contributions to the project from India are significant; they are, after all, the second most prolific country in code contributions after the USA, and then only by a small margin.</td>

<p>I very much enjoyed a session on “college leaver” education in Drupal by Sharmila Kumaran. It seems that she has developed a system by which they spend time exposing a lot of students to Drupal and then identify those who they think have potential to move into Drupal careers. Pretty standard stuff but then they mentioned the scale of the operation and I sat up: In 2019, they are expecting to have exposed over 6,000 (yes, six thousand) college-aged people to Drupal and how it works. Is there anyone else, anywhere in the World, educating people in Drupal at this scale??</p>
